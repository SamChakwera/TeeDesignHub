# TeeDesignHub AI-Powered 3D Website Built with React and ThreeJS

## Project Overview
In this project, we build an AI-powered 3D website using React and ThreeJS. The website showcases a product in 3D, giving users an interactive experience with the product. We also infuse the website with artificial intelligence using DALLE AI to generate custom images.

## Technologies Used
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

## Key Features
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Make code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices.
- Add custom color and file support.
- Generate and use images through DALLE AI.
- Download the resulting t-shirt model image.
- Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve the site's performance.
